# Future Sprint — javalens as a networked service (HTTPS, auth, multi-user)

> **Status: future outlook, no committed sprint number.** This document captures a strategic direction surfaced during the 2026-04-26 Sprint 10 architecture discussion. It is **not** scheduled. It is recorded so that when the driver materializes — likely a multi-developer team or shared analysis service — the work has a starting point and the decision rationale is preserved.

## Context

Today javalens is a **local, single-user developer tool**. It runs on your machine, talks to your MCP clients (cursor / claude / antigravity / IntelliJ) via stdio, indexes your local Java projects. javalens-manager configures and orchestrates these processes for one user on one machine.

During the Sprint 10 design pass we considered four transport architectures for the multi-project workspace feature:

| Option | Transport | Scope | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stdio + multi-path startup | stdio | Local single-user | Sprint 10 baseline |
| Stdio + file-watch (`workspace.json`) | stdio | Local single-user, transparent live updates | **Chosen for Sprint 10** |
| HTTP localhost servlet | HTTP, no auth, localhost-only | Local single-user, shared process per workspace | Considered, deferred — file-watch is sufficient for local |
| HTTPS + auth + multi-user | HTTPS+auth | **Networked, multi-developer team** | This document |

The first three serve the same use case (single developer on a single machine). The fourth is a fundamentally different product shape and is the subject of this document.

## When this becomes worth building

Real signals — not hypotheticals:

- **A team wants to share a workspace.** Two or more developers analyze the same Java codebase from their own machines and would benefit from a shared, pre-indexed JDT workspace running on a beefy server.
- **CI / agent farms.** Automated agents (refactor bots, code-review assistants, migration runners) run on infrastructure separate from developer machines and need consistent JDT analysis service.
- **Cold-start cost is unacceptable.** Big workspaces (think: full enterprise monolith) take minutes to index. Pre-indexing on a server and connecting from many clients amortizes that cost.
- **Compliance / centralization.** A team policy mandates that source code analysis runs in a controlled environment, not on individual developer laptops.

If none of those exist, **don't build this.** The local stdio model fits the realistic single-developer use case (1-3 workspaces, big-but-bounded JATS-style projects, ~weekly add/remove events) and adds no friction.

## What it actually requires

A networked javalens service is **a different product** from the local tool. The honest checklist:

### Transport
- HTTPS with TLS certificates (Let's Encrypt or org CA).
- MCP over HTTP+SSE or Streamable HTTP transport (which the MCP Java SDK supports — but javalens's current hand-rolled `McpProtocolHandler` would need either an SDK migration or a parallel HTTP layer).
- Reverse proxy front (nginx / Caddy) for TLS termination, rate limiting, IP allowlisting.

### Authentication
- Token-based auth (JWT, API keys, or OAuth 2.1 — MCP spec defines the OAuth flow for clients).
- Per-user identity tied to MCP sessions.
- Token issuance / rotation / revocation.

### Authorization
- Per-workspace access control: which users can see which workspaces?
- Per-tool authorization: should refactoring tools be agent-callable on a shared workspace? Probably not without explicit per-session opt-in (writes are dangerous).
- Audit log: who called what tool with what arguments at what time. Critical for compliance use cases.

### Multi-user session management
- Session isolation: two users analyzing the same workspace should each have their own JDT search scope (or at least their own request lifecycle).
- Session quotas: prevent one user from monopolizing the JDT indexer with a 10-minute deep analysis.
- Concurrent-edit semantics: if two users have refactor tools open, what happens when one moves a class while another is searching for references in it?

### Operations
- Process supervisor (systemd / supervisord) — javalens must auto-restart on crash without losing user sessions if possible.
- Log aggregation, metrics export (Prometheus), alerting.
- Backup / restore for the JDT data dir (re-indexing big workspaces from scratch is expensive).
- Health endpoints separate from MCP endpoints (load balancers care about HTTP 200, not JSON-RPC).
- Graceful shutdown: drain in-flight requests, persist any pending state, close cleanly.

### User management UI
- A web UI (or extension to javalens-manager) for: creating users, issuing tokens, granting workspace access, viewing audit logs, managing workspaces.
- This is its own product surface and probably its own sprint.

### Realistic scope estimate
A first usable version: **2-3 sprints minimum** (~6-8 weeks of focused work). A production-ready version with all the operational polish: **larger and ongoing**.

## Why this reinforces "stay on the fork"

This is the primary new argument for not PR'ing back to upstream `pzalutski-pixel/javalens-mcp`:

1. **Upstream's design is local stdio.** The README architecture diagram explicitly shows `JSON-RPC over stdio` with a single MCP client. Adding HTTPS + auth + multi-user fundamentally diverges from upstream's product identity. It's not a small "feature to PR back" — it's a different product.
2. **The work is large and opinionated.** Auth/TLS/user-management decisions are highly opinionated and depend on the deployer's environment (cloud provider, IdP, compliance regime). Upstream cannot serve all those choices well; a fork can pick one path that fits one user's needs.
3. **Operational ownership.** If javalens runs as a hosted service for your team, you own the operations: SLAs, security patches, ops runbook, oncall. Upstream cannot take this on.
4. **Independence already paid for.** Sprint 9-11 work has been built under the portability constraint (ADR 0004). The networked-service work would extend that fork unambiguously, not contaminate the local-tool design upstream cares about.

The pre-existing reasons to defer the upstream PR (Sprint 11 backlog "Independence posture" section) all still apply. This is one more, and it's the strongest.

## Adjacent work that should land first

If/when this sprint becomes real, these prerequisites should be in place:

- **Sprint 10 + 11 stable**: multi-project workspaces (file-watched), Tycho/Bundle pool detection, tool consolidation, structural refactorings — all proven on the local product before extending to a networked one.
- **HTTP transport in javalens-mcp** (could be Sprint 12 or 13 standalone — local-only HTTPS-disabled HTTP for testing): the foundation that this sprint extends with auth/TLS.
- **MCP Java SDK migration** (likely): replacing the hand-rolled `McpProtocolHandler` with the official SDK gets HTTP+SSE / Streamable HTTP transport for free, and tracks future MCP spec evolution. Worth doing before adding auth / session management on top of a hand-rolled implementation.
- **Production-grade test coverage** of the existing tools — exposing them to a multi-user network surface raises the bar for tool-side correctness (input validation, error handling, resource cleanup).

## Open questions to resolve when scheduled

- **Single-tenant or multi-tenant?** One javalens deployment per team, or one per user? Affects the auth model.
- **Self-hosted only, or also a managed offering?** The latter is a different business shape.
- **Which IdP integration?** OIDC, SAML, GitHub OAuth, custom — depends on team environment.
- **What's the minimum viable feature set to ship a first usable network release?** Probably: HTTPS + token auth + per-workspace ACL + audit log. Skip OAuth, skip web UI v1.
- **Compatibility with javalens-manager?** Does the local manager UI also become a networked-service admin client, or is admin a separate web UI? Latter is cleaner.
- **Pricing / licensing model** if this becomes a paid product (separate from the open-source local tool).

## Out of scope for this document

- Detailed implementation plan (deferred until scheduled).
- Choice of HTTP framework, auth library, etc. (depends on requirements at scheduling time).
- Comparison to existing networked code-analysis services (SonarQube, JetBrains Code With Me, etc.) — useful context when scheduled.
